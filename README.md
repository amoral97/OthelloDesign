# OthelloDesign

Othello (otherwise known as known as Reversis) is a strategy board for two players, and played on an 8x8 uncheckered board.
To play the game, there are 64 identical disk pieces, which are light on white side and dark on the other.
Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up, and during a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.

To "win" the game, the majority of the disks corresponding to a player's assigned color that remain when the last playable empty square is filled wins the game!
